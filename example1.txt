This text is written in Markdown style.

* You can have bullet-lists.
	* There can be sub-items.
	* This is a second sub-item.
* In addition to bullet-lists, you can have numbered lists.

1. This is the first item of a numbered list.
	1. Just as with bullet lists, there can be sub-items.
1. This is the second item of a numbered list.

There are a few additional features of this text that go beyond what Markdown normally offers.  
For example, you can add as many +{hashtags} to each line as you like.  
This line has two +{hashtags}, one of which is embedded in this sentence, and the other of which comes after it: +{example}

+{Hashtags} can be delimited by any marker you like (e.g., #hashtag, +hashtag, @hashtag, etc.). The default notation, with curly braces, is nice because it allows +{hashtags with spaces}.

The intended use for +{Markdown Mapper} is for +{notes} (e.g., class notes, or notes on +{academic articles}).

When you're reading +{academic articles}, you may come across a point that you want to remember especially well.  
-->You can mark a note as being of especial importance by surrounding it with arrows.<--

You might also want to note original ideas that you had while reading. You can note those by marking them like this: {{This is an original idea that I want to remember.}}

{{Original ideas}} can be combined with -->+{notes} of importance<-- as well as +{hashtags}.

Markdown Mapper goes through text files like this line-by-line and reverse-engineers a network map from them.

* For bullet lists, items are linked by parent/child status.
	* This is a "child" line; the line immediately above, with one less indentation, is the "parent."
		* You can indent as many times as you want.

You can also mark a line as being linked to the line above it, even if it's not in a list or connected through a hashtag.  
To do that, just use this symbol anywhere in the line: ^^^
